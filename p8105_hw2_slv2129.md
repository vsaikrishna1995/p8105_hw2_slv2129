## Problem 2

Reading, cleaning and manipulating the NYC transit dataset

``` r
nyctran_df = 
  read.csv("C:/Users/Krishna/Desktop/Sem 3/Data Science/Assignment 2/p8105_hw2_slv2129/data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  subset(select = c(2:16, 18, 20, 17, 23)) %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = T, NO = F))
```

Describing the NYC transit dataset:

This dataset provides data on New York city transit data associated with
subway station system. Specifically, this dataset stores information
related to entrance and exit for every NYC station. This dataset
contains the following variables: line, station\_name,
station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4,
route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry,
vending, entrance\_type, ada. As part of the data cleaning process, the
variable names have been transformed to match the appropriate naming
convention using the janitor library function and the data type of entry
variable has been convereted from character to logical. Although the
original dataset consisted of many variables, only a specific set of
variables that are mentioned above were retained in the dataset after
the cleaning process. This dataset has the following dimension (row,
columns): 1868, 19. After assessing the dataframe, it can inferred that
the data can’t be considered tidy because of the dataframe structure
associated with the route number and name columns.

Answering the questions given:

``` r
nycdist_df = nyctran_df %>% distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = T)
dist_stations = nrow(nycdist_df)

ada_comp = nycdist_df %>% filter(ada == T) %>% nrow()

prop_novend_enter = ((nyctran_df %>% filter(vending == "NO" & entry == T) %>% nrow()) / 
                       (nyctran_df %>% filter(vending == "NO") %>% nrow())) %>% round(3)

dist_routes_df = nyctran_df %>% distinct(route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, .keep_all = T)

dist_stations_A_df = dist_routes_df %>% filter(route1 == "A" | route2 == "A" | route3 == "A" | route4 == "A" | route5 == "A" | route6 == "A" | route7 == "A" | route8 == "A"| route9 == "A" | route10 == "A" | route11 == "A")

ada_comp_A = dist_stations_A_df %>% filter(ada == T) %>% nrow()
```

How many distinct stations are there?  
There are 465 distinct stations in NYC subway system.

How many stations are ADA compliant?  
There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?  
0.377 proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance.

How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations that serve
the A train, how many are ADA compliant?  
There are 19 distinct stations that serve the A train. Among these
stations, 9 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Reading, cleaning and manipulating pols-month, a dataset related to the
number of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any
given time:

``` r
pols_month_df = read.csv("C:/Users/Krishna/Desktop/Sem 3/Data Science/Assignment 2/p8105_hw2_slv2129/data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
             separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = T) %>%
             mutate(month = month.name[month], president = NA,
                    president = ifelse(prez_gop == 0 & prez_dem == 1, "dem", 
                                ifelse(prez_gop == 1 & prez_dem == 0, "gop", NA))) %>% 
             select(-c(day, prez_gop, prez_dem)) %>%
             clean_names()
```

Reading, cleaning and manipulating snp, a dataset related to Standard &
Poor’s stock market index (S\&P):

``` r
snp_df = read.csv("C:/Users/Krishna/Desktop/Sem 3/Data Science/Assignment 2/p8105_hw2_slv2129/data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
         separate(date, into = c("day", "month", "year"), sep = "/", convert = T) %>%
         mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
         select(-day) %>%
         subset(select = c(year, month, close)) %>%
         arrange(year, month) %>%
         clean_names() 
```

Reading and manipulating unemployment dataset:

``` r
unemploy_df = read.csv("C:/Users/Krishna/Desktop/Sem 3/Data Science/Assignment 2/p8105_hw2_slv2129/data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
              pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "percent_unemployment") %>%
              mutate(month = match(month, month.abb), month = month.name[month]) %>%
              clean_names()
```

Merging snp\_df into pols\_month\_df, and merging unemploy\_df into the
result:

``` r
pols_snp_mergedf = left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) 
final_mergedf = left_join(pols_snp_mergedf, unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))

yr_range = final_mergedf %>% select(year) %>% range()
```

Describing the datasets:

pols-month is a dataset related to the number of national politicians
who are democratic or republican at any given time and snp is a dataset
related to Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P). The unemployment
dataset consists of information related to unemployment percentage with
respect to years and months. All the substituent components of these
datasets have been appropriately modified prior to the merging step. The
merged dataframe consists of year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop,
gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president, close, percent\_unemployment
variables and has the following dimension (row, columns): 1391, 11. The
data presented in this dataframe is associated with the years between
1947 and 2015.
